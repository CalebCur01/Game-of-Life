# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life. First we randomly determine which cells start as "alive" or "dead". Then we update according to the following rules:

1) Any cell with less than 2 living neighbors dies
2) Cells with 2 or 3 living neighbors survive to the next turn
3) Any cell with more than 3 living neighbors dies
4) Dead cells with exactly 3 living neighbors become alive.
